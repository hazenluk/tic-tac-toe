# tic-tac-toe
Test programs I wrote while learning rust.

minimax is a tic-tac-toe game vs a bot using a minimax algorithm.  
Compile with the following to produce binaries in minimax/target/release:  
```
cd minimax
cargo build --release
```

online_multiplayer contains a tcp client and host server for playing online tic-tac-toe against another player.  
Compile with the following to produce binaries in online_multiplayer/target/release:  
```
cd online_multiplayer
cargo build --release
```
